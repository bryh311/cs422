1. using the socket api, you can lookup the hostname by using getaddrinfo(). This command
stores all of the ip addresses associated with a given hostname into a linked list, and when
connecting, it cycles through the linked list trying ip addresses to connect to.

2. it gives the connecting computer more ways to connect with the server, which imporves
reliability compared to just using a single ip address which the clienet might not be able to 
connect with.

3. some issues that could arise with using a specific IP address could include load balancing,
if a server has a hostname bound to multiple IP addresses, it can load balance the clients to
different network interfaces, which can't be done with using just the IP address. Another issue
that could arise with using a specific IP address is DHCP, which changes the IP addresses dynamically
but not the hostname

4. every client on the different networks can check each of the IPs and connect to the one that
uses the network that they are connected to.
